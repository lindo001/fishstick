Testing out a simple idea I had on the bus: a multiplayer zombie shoot 'em up game.

### Things to Fix:
- Zombie limitless attacks
- Zombie bugs out once player dies

### Features to Add:
- Waves with 2 bosses
- Different player characters
- Multiplayer support
- Improved UI
- Enhanced graphics
- Scrollable levels (like in Beat 'em up games)
- Main menu
- Blood effects when enemies are shot
- Item drops: Coins and Health
